\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Teaching DSA}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Why DSA?}
  Data Structures and Algorithms are an essential topic in Computer Science-related fields, and form the foundation of many higher-level concepts in CS.
  \note{...therefore, it's v. important for students to develop a solid understand of DSA earlier in their studies. This importance is the motivation for focusing our research on developing tools for teaching DSA}

  \frametitle{DSA Curriculum}
  The ACM CS2013 provides guidelines on subjects that should be taught in an undergrad CS course. Algorithms \& Complexity is identified as a core Knowledge Area and within that the knowledge unit of Fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms.

  \begin{block}{Our Implementation}
  We will focus on teaching Fundamental DSA for the purposes of the tool we intend to develop.

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Simple Numeric Algorithms
    \item Sequential and Binary Search
    \item Quadractic and $\Omega(n\log(n))$ sorting algorithms
    \item Hash tables and collisions
    \item Binary search trees
    \item Graphs and common graph algorithms
    \item Heaps
    \item Pattern matching/string algorithms
  \end{itemize}
  \note{These are the fundamental DSA as defined by CS2013. While it is beyond the scope of this project to implement all of these in our tool, we will focus on a subset of these DSAs and take into the learning outcomes mentioned in CS2013 when working on the content to implement in our tool}
